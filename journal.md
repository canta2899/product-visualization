# Journal

This journal's aim is to present and describe the strategies and decisions chosen for this project.

## Choosing the product

After thinking about it for a while, we decided to use a collection of glasse as our product.
We found a group of `.obj` files that we are able to use and we are now searching for some interesting material and a strategic environmental map to start out work. 

Later on, we'll have to find out the best shaders and think about the lightning. 

Our glasses will have a few materials avaiable: 

- Glass
- Wood
- Iron
- Plastic

## Giving some context

To give our project some context we decided to build a small website that includes a main page and a visualization menu in order to render all the products. The company is supposed to sell glasses of different materials and different shapes and gives the user the ability to explore them directly online. 

The website uses public domain images and bootstrap classes.
