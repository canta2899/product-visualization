# Journal

This journal's aim is to present and describe the strategies and decisions chosen for this project.

## Choosing the product

After thinking about it for a while, we decided to use a collection of glasse as our product.
We found a group of `.obj` files that we are able to use and we are now searching for some interesting material and a strategic environmental map to start out work. 

Later on, we'll have to find out the best shaders and think about the lightning.
